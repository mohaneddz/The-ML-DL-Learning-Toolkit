# üåê Machine Learning & Deep Learning Toolkit

This repository contains various templates and examples for machine learning and deep learning projects. It is organized into several directories, each focusing on different aspects and techniques of ML & DL. Most of these resources were necessary while tackling the **Machine Learning & Deep Learning A-Z course** and were required for proper understanding and implementation.

## üìù Directories and Files

### Deep Learning

- **Machine Learning Basics**: Contains templates for fundamental ML tasks such as classification and data preprocessing.
- **Supervised Deep Learning**: Includes examples and templates for ANN, CNN, and RNN models.
- **Unsupervised Deep Learning**: Covers techniques such as AutoEncoders, Boltzmann Machines, GANs, and SOMs.

### Machine Learning

- **`clean.py`**: A script to remove code cells from Jupyter notebooks, making them shareable without exposing code.
- **Templates**: Includes templates for major ML tasks:
  - Regression
  - Classification
  - Clustering
  - Association Rule Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Deep Learning
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Model Selection

### Training

- Contains datasets and training scripts used in various ML & DL tasks.

## üí™ Usage

### Cleaning Jupyter Notebooks

Use the `clean.py` script to strip code cells from Jupyter notebooks:

```sh
python Machine Learning/clean.py
```

### Running Templates

Each template contains scripts and notebooks that can be executed to perform specific ML/DL tasks. Navigate to the required template directory and follow the instructions in the README or notebooks.
